# HoloDuel Server
This is the server repo for HoloDuel.
This is a fan implementation of the Hololive card game.
I have no affiliation with Cover/Hololive. I own none of the assets/IP.

# Setup
Install python 3.12.
Clone repo.
(preferably create a virtual environment "python -m venv venv" then activate it with active.cmd)
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the server: runserver.cmd
